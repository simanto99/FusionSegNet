FusionSegNet Architecture

FusionSegNet is a deep neural network architecture designed for precise medical image segmentation, incorporating advanced multi-scale feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and uncertainty modeling. The architecture integrates several key modules to progressively refine features, capture contextual dependencies, and handle prediction uncertainty.  


Key Components: FMSAN Encoder: Combines feed-forward networks (FFN), Multi-Scale Contextual Attention Units (MCAU), and Fuzzy Learning Modules (FLM) in each stage. MCAU uses depthwise separable convolutions with varying kernel sizes to capture multi-scale spatial patterns, followed by channel attention refinement via ECA. FLM models uncertainty at the feature level using fuzzy membership functions and integrates Monte Carlo dropout for pixel-wise uncertainty estimation.  GMFAM Module: Fuses multi-scale features from different encoder stages using adaptive gating, multi-scale convolutions, and channel-wise attention to enhance discriminative power.  AAFM Module: Applies atrous (dilated) convolutions with increasing dilation rates to capture broader contextual information, integrated with efficient channel attention for precise feature refinement.  HMAA Module: Employs hierarchical multi-axis attention with both local and global context modeling, utilizing dense connections and dynamic gating mechanisms.  WMFM Module: Implements weighted multi-scale fusion of encoder features using trainable attention weights, promoting robustness to noise and variability in the data.  


Architecture Highlights: Multi-scale spatial and channel attention at every stage.  Fuzzy logic-based uncertainty modeling for improved prediction reliability.  Efficient feature refinement and fusion modules for context-aware segmentation.  Residual connections and skip pathways to preserve spatial resolution and gradient flow.  


Applications: This architecture is particularly suited for medical image segmentation tasks, such as lesion boundary delineation, organ segmentation, and anomaly detection in ultrasound, MRI, and CT imaging.
